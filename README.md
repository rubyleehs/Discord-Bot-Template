# Discord Bot Template
 
How to use:

Just add the commands you want if the commands folder.
See example.js.

You may call the command by simply typing the bot prefix folloed by the command filename.
Magic happens in events/message.js

Note that your command filenames should be all lowercase.
If you wish to change this, just tweak events/message.js slightly
